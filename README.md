This program utilizes pygame to allow one to play Minesweeper.<br/>
In the future, the plan is to implement a solver to play the game for us, if possible.<br/>
The only case in which it would prove impossible to solve would be when the only option is to guess the next correct tile (i.e. 50/50 probability).<br/>

**Controls**
* **LClick**: uncover tile
* **RClick**: flag tile
* **R**: restart game
* **I**: zoom in (restarts game)
* **O**: zoom out (restarts game)
* **P**: pause game
* **Q**: quit game<br/>
*Optional* (mainly intended for auto-clicking)
**A**: uncover tile (~left click)
**S**: flag tile (~right click)
